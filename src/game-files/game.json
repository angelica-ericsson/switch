Many residents have seen generations of family members go to work at the factory - or worked there themselves - and all of us have an emotional relationship with the company that has been regarded as the financial backbone of the town for decades. So when the company management admitted to having financial difficulties a few years back, many residents stepped up to help by purchasing their products. And even though many have complained about the declining quality of the clothing items, the name WildertonWear has nonetheless been a source of pride for the community. However, the Daily Times can now reveal that the love has not been mutual. Over the past five years, WildertonWear has paid exactly zero municipality taxes. In an interview with the Daily Times, the company CEO, Bert Swindle, explains that the company always intended to pay the taxes “as soon as the financial situation stabilised”.","textB":null,"date":null,"daysSinceGameStart":0}},{"id":"FDL4XW8RGUtItENas8Abo","type":"scene","position":{"x":-380.2926058372454,"y":2236.775818165949},"data":{"textA":"It is time to stock up on items for the coming month.
